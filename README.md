# Postman Collection for Extension Developers

## PLEASE NOTE

**Launch extension development no longer requires the integration environment.**

**Please use the [reactor-postman repo](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-postman) instead.**

This Postman collection was originally intended to help developers work with the Launch (non-prod) integration environment.

Since the release of private extension features the [release process](https://developer.adobelaunch.com/guides/extensions/getting-started/#releasing-your-extension) for extension developers has changed. We no longer require the integration environment in your workflow.

**The [reactor-postman repo](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-postman) contains all the latest examples for working with the Launch APIs. Please use the postman collection in that repo. Thanks.**

~~* **List**: list the extension packages in the integration environment~~
