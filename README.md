# Postman Collection for Extension Developers

A [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection for extension developers working with [Launch, by Adobe](http://developer.adobelaunch.com/guides/extensions/quickstart/).

This file contains a [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collections/data_formats#importing-postman-data) you can import to your Postman application. It contains the structure for the following API calls:

* **Upload**: the initial upload of your extension package to the integration environment
* **List**: list the extension packages in the integration environment
* **Get status**: get the status and details of an extension package in the integration environment
* **Patch**: patch your extension package in the integration environment

You'll need to be authorized for extension development and acces to this environment. The [Getting Started Guide](http://developer.adobelaunch.com/guides/extensions/getting-started/) has all the details.
